[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/circuitcode/AsyncTCP.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/circuitcode/AsyncTCP) ![](https://github.com/circuitcode/AsyncTCP/workflows/Async%20TCP%20CI/badge.svg)

### Async TCP Library for ESP32 Arduino

This is a fully asynchronous TCP library, aimed at enabling trouble-free, multi-connection network environment for Espressif's ESP32 MCUs.

This library is the base for [ESPAsyncWebServer](https://github.com/circuitcode/ESPAsyncWebServer)

## AsyncClient and AsyncServer

The base classes on which everything else is built. They expose all possible scenarios, but are really raw and require more skills to use.
